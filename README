This houses the website and infrastructure for the Maldives Open Source Society
(MOSS) hosted at moss.org.mv, and is infact a compact application framework and
content management system written in PHP.

When this project matures, it can be used to build websites easily. It is also
an objective of the project to sport modules that enable ngos and not for
profits to run their websites and manage other aspects of their organizations
through the website in a central manner.

The project is developed using the latest version of the Zend Framework and uses
the Ext Core javascript framework where javascript is required, and we believe
the requirements for the development of a software project is only complete when
you use git as an scm.
