-------------------------
been trying to migrate the core code base from zf 1.6/1.7 to 1.9. bringing about
the changes and new features introduced to the mvc components. the application
is now bootstrapped as a Zend_Application app. meaning the the toolings features
can be used with a project's layout.

certain quirks have been found with the previous model of application controller
abstraction and the use of models. the new version introduces the notion of
dbtables such that they are made use of by an application through mapper class.

need to find out the most conveniet ways of accessing the application resources
such as db (adapter) and config.
